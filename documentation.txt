Documentation for Revive Adserver hosting configuration
=======================================================

Installation location
---------------------
The starting assumption is that we've installed the software on a virtual host
of domain name example.com, on a sub domain called 'main', and in a folder named
'base'. The resulting location therefore is main.example.com/base/

The physical location of the installation for the purpose of this project is
going to be /var/www/virtual/main.example.com/base/

During the installation process, the Revive Adserver install wizard has created
a configuration file called main.example.com.conf.php, which can be found in the
'var' folder (/var/www/virtual/main.example.com/base/var/) on the server.
